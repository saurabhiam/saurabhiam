# Hello, nerds

I code frequently and write some awesome frontend applications. My latest deal is I'm making as many useful things with React. I also have some normal life (yes, that exists) in which I usually travel, cook vegan cuisines, and indulge myself in hardcore gaming.

I love chocolates and rock music. I work at Sophos. If you want to reach out to me you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/saurabhiam), [~~Instagram~~](https://instagram.com/saurabhiam) and you can view my [Portfolio](https://saurabhsharma.me). If you are looking for collaboration / pro-bono consultation, you can drop me an email on <me@saurabhsharma.me>.

✌️✌️
